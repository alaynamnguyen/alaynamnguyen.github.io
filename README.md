This repository contains the code for my personal website.

## About

I built this website to showcase my projects and experiences. It's designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

This project was inspired by and built off of a tutorial available at [html-css-js-portfolio-tutorial-2](https://github.com/Ade-mir/html-css-js-portfolio-tutorial-2).

## Features

- **Dark Mode Toggle:** Offers a dark mode toggle feature to enhance user experience.
- **Responsive Design:** Ensures the website looks great on various devices.
